        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Technology has infiltrated every aspect of our lives- our smartphones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches, speakers, and even our fridges are getting smarter day by day! Our workplace is no different.

            From raising money for your company and brainstorming creative ideas to HR and customer service, technology has taken over every inch of business operations.
            
            Thanks to technology, your workplace is wherever you decide to sit down. An office can be your favorite coffee shop, your couch, a bar, or a co-working space like WeWork. The lines between a physical office and the place where work actually happens are blurred.
            
            Remote working is the norm. According to the American Community Survey, telecommuting has risen 79 percent between 2005 and 2012 and now makes up 2.6 percent of the American workforce, or 3.2 million workers.</p>

        <h1 class="sectiontag text-big">What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h1>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Back in the 1950s, the fathers of the field, Minsky and McCarthy, described artificial intelligence as any task performed by a machine that would have previously been considered to require human intelligence.

            That's obviously a fairly broad definition, which is why you will sometimes see arguments over whether something is truly AI or not.
            
            Modern definitions of what it means to create intelligence are more specific. Francois Chollet, an AI researcher at Google and creator of the machine-learning software library Keras, has said intelligence is tied to a system's ability to adapt and improvise in a new environment, to generalise its knowledge and apply it to unfamiliar scenarios.
            
            "Intelligence is the efficiency with which you acquire new skills at tasks you didn't previously prepare for," he said.
            
            "Intelligence is not skill itself; it's not what you can do; it's how well and how efficiently you can learn new things."
            
            It's a definition under which modern AI-powered systems, such as virtual assistants, would be characterised as having demonstrated 'narrow AI', the ability to generalise their training when carrying out a limited set of tasks, such as speech recognition or computer vision.
            
            Typically, AI systems demonstrate at least some of the following behaviours associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.</p>

        <h1 class="sectiontag text-big">The Impact of Digital Technologies</h1>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Digital technologies have advanced more rapidly than any innovation in our history – reaching around 50 per cent of the developing world’s population in only two decades and transforming societies. By enhancing connectivity, financial inclusion, access to trade and public services, technology can be a great equaliser.

            In the health sector, for instance, AI-enabled frontier technologies are helping to save lives, diagnose diseases and extend life expectancy. In education, virtual learning environments and distance learning have opened up programmes to students who would otherwise be excluded. Public services are also becoming more accessible and accountable through blockchain-powered systems, and less bureaucratically burdensome as a result of AI assistance.Big data can also support more responsive and accurate policies and programmes.
            
            However, those yet to be connected remain cut off from the benefits of this new era and remain further behind. Many of the people left behind are women, the elderly, persons with disabilities or from ethnic or linguistic minorities, indigenous groups and residents of poor or remote areas. The pace of connectivity is slowing, even reversing, among some constituencies. For example, globally, the proportion of women using the internet is 12 per cent lower than that of men. While this gap narrowed in most regions between 2013 and 2017, it widened in the least developed countries from 30 per cent to 33 per cent.
            
            The use of algorithms can replicate and even amplify human and systemic bias where they function on the basis of data which is not adequately diverse. Lack of diversity in the technology sector can mean that this challenge is not adequately addressed.</p>
